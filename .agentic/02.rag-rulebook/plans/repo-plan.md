# RAG/Rulebook Repo Plan

## Goal

Create a portable RAG/rulebook service model that can support multiple modular
domain corpora without folding product, design-system, deployment, education,
and harness instructions into one harness-owned corpus.

Corpus IDs should align with the numbered layer system, including
`corpus.02.rag-rulebook` as the self-corpus for the service's own governance.

## Current State

The repo has a first-class `02.rag-rulebook` layer and a prototype architecture
rulebook under `docs/harness/architecture/`.

The prototype rulebook proves useful structure:

- source guides
- YAML layer rulesets
- YAML concern rulesets
- YAML task rule packs
- source references
- metadata headers

The location is not the final domain corpus model.

## Ordered Plan

1. Define the portable service contract.
   - Status: present in `standards/portable-service-contract.md`.

2. Define the domain corpus package shape.
   - Status: present in `standards/domain-corpus-package.md`.
   - Corpus IDs now align with numbered layers.

3. Design a context-packet schema.
   - Include intent, routing metadata, matched corpora, selected chunks,
     required checks, stop conditions, citations, confidence, and gaps.
   - Status: present in `schemas/context-packet.schema.yml`.

3a. Inventory the prototype corpus and migration targets.
   - Map current `docs/harness/architecture/` source guides, ADRs, YAML layer
     rulesets, concern rulesets, and rule packs to proposed numbered corpus
     packages.
   - Do not move files in this step.
   - Status: present in `plans/prototype-corpus-migration-map.yml`.

4. Design a rulebook index schema.
   - Include corpus IDs, artifact IDs, rule IDs, chunk IDs, path globs,
     source refs, required rulesets, related rulesets, and graph edges.
   - Support both current prototype paths and proposed corpus package paths.

5. Add a read-only index generator.
   - Parse the current prototype YAML rulebook.
   - Emit deterministic JSON.
   - Validate duplicate IDs and missing references.
   - Do not use embeddings or network calls.

6. Add a chunk generator.
   - Chunk by YAML structure, not arbitrary character windows.
   - Preserve parent artifact IDs, rule IDs, paths, source refs, and severity.

7. Add context-packet validation.
   - Validate packet shape and references.
   - Report gaps when retrieval is ambiguous or insufficient.

8. Plan the prototype corpus migration.
   - Separate harness-owned rules from `corpus.03.product`,
     `corpus.03.product.design-system`, `corpus.04.deploy`, and
     `corpus.05.education`.
   - Include `corpus.02.rag-rulebook` as a self-corpus for service governance.
   - Use artifact path migration before moving committed files.

9. Only after the above, design a standalone service or repo extraction.
   - The service should consume corpus packages and generated indexes.
   - The workbench should call the service; it should not own the service.

## Non-Goals For The Current Stage

- Do not build the RAG server.
- Do not build an MCP server.
- Do not move `docs/harness/architecture/` files.
- Do not introduce embeddings before deterministic indexes and chunks exist.
- Do not merge domain corpora into one instruction set.

## Next Small Slice

Create the rulebook index schema as a RAG/Rulebook layer artifact.
