# L001 — packages/core

<!-- course-folder: packages/core -->

## What you will understand

Core defines provider-independent facts and their allowed shapes. It must remain usable without a server, AWS account or particular database.

After this lesson, explain why this folder participates in diagnostics, distinguish its old and new responsibilities, and follow every changed file below. The directory owns **1 changed file** in the frozen course inventory. Subfolders have their own lessons; they are not silently absorbed into this one.

## Start with a concrete case

Compare a raw exception with an object carrying code, definitionVersion, schema and detail. Add an undeclared detail property: parsing must reject that record. A valid shape still does not prove that the claimed event happened; the producer must have observed it.

Before reading on, predict which facts are known and which would be guesses. This is a reasoning exercise with synthetic conditions; do not run a deployment, administration task or destructive command.

## Before and after the project

**Before:** The baseline already had diagnostic classifications and monitoring concepts. Those useful abstractions did not, by themselves, give every capability a closed, versioned record that a reader could validate.

**After:** Definitions declare a stable code, version, classification and permitted detail. Constructors copy and validate records; selectors accept only explicitly selected evidence. Shared helpers bound related evidence to eight records.

**Why this was needed:** A description written by an agent is not a runtime contract. Code-owned definitions let producers and readers agree without interpreting prose or trusting an arbitrary error object.

This directory contains `documentation` work. A test proves a boundary, a generated export shares meaning, documentation instructs, and runtime code performs or observes work. Do not confuse those roles because they share a folder prefix.

## Every changed file

The comparison is against `d94da2b9401d3abcf86618b5d497e9b93903490a`. “Added” means absent at that commit, not that the whole capability was invented here. The file-specific explanations below take precedence over the broader folder summary.

<!-- course-file: packages/core/README.md -->

### README.md

[Open current source](../../../../../packages/core/README.md) · **Snapshot:** modified existing file; 96 added / 2 removed lines. These are textual counts, not a count of new features.

**What it does:** Human-facing ownership, contract or workflow guidance.

**Before:** The existing document described the earlier boundary without this project's additional diagnostic requirements.

**After:** Explains the diagnostic responsibilities and compatibility limits for the diagnostic language; read the sections `@kanbien/core`, `Boundary`, `Changing Core Contracts Safely`, `Shared Primitives`, `Diagnostics Contracts`. The source diff distinguishes actual rule changes from header/date updates.

**Why:** Documentation and executable rules must describe the same ownership; otherwise an agent can follow stale guidance while changing correct code. This file is not a runtime diagnostic producer.

Reading anchors: `@kanbien/core`; `Boundary`; `Changing Core Contracts Safely`; `Shared Primitives`; `Diagnostics Contracts`; `Translation-Ready Meaning`.

Proving boundary: inspect the affected file's registered inputs in [the check catalog](../../../../../scripts/repo/check-selection/checks.yml) and its linked neighboring tests. Setup/export files are not independently operating services.

## Work through it together

Use the [30-minute core / 50-minute extension protocol](../facilitator-guide.md). The core follows one worked example; a large folder's remaining file entries continue in subsequent meetings rather than being marked covered by a quick skim.

1. Open each source link above, then read its before/after entry aloud in your own words. Mark each file separately in [the file checklist](../file-index.md).
2. Find one actual guard, call, declaration or assertion behind the explanation. For documentation/receipts, find the rule or evidence being recorded instead.
3. Answer: Why must a schema-valid record from an arbitrary caller not automatically become trusted evidence about a database call?
4. Trace one upstream owner and one downstream consumer. If a module has no deployed consumer, stop at its actual caller/test; do not invent one.
5. State what the observation proves, what stays unknown, and which sensitive values are deliberately absent.

**Debrief / answer direction:** Shape validation establishes admissible data, not truth, exhaustiveness or remote delivery. A strong answer distinguishes observed location, supported cause and effect; an unsupported certainty is not extra granularity.

## Evidence and boundaries

[Folder in the checkout](../../../../../packages/core) · [Baseline, current proof and deferrals](../sources-and-limits.md) · [Plain-language glossary](../glossary.md)

Neighboring folder lessons: [L002 packages/core/contracts](002-packages-core-contracts.md) · [L003 packages/core/src](003-packages-core-src.md) · [L006 packages/core/tests](006-packages-core-tests.md).

**Facilitator check:** begin with the concrete case, explain only the terms needed here, let the learner predict before showing the source, and do not mark the folder complete until all 1 file entries have been discussed. Clarify any source/annotation disagreement in the notes instead of explaining it away.
