# PostgreSQL relational smoke proof

`npm run platform:shell:postgresql-relational-smoke -- --validate` checks the
committed `kanbien/staging` policy without contacting AWS.

After the reviewed Foundation and service change sets are deployed, the only
live invocation is:

```bash
npm run platform:shell:postgresql-relational-smoke -- --execute --approve-relational-stage6
```

It has no caller-selected target, credentials, task, queue, database, restore
name, network, payload, or timeout. It first confirms the fixed account,
Foundation/service readiness, public server `1/1`, dormant worker `0/0`, and
empty isolated queues. It then runs one bootstrap task, one migration task,
one fixed-record relay task, one worker task, and one isolated restore check.

The restore is private and disposable. The controller waits for the restored
instance, checks the fixed smoke state through a dedicated `verify-full` TLS
task, and deletes that recovery instance without a final snapshot. It retains
no endpoint, task identifier, secret, record contents, queue message, raw log,
or provider response; its only terminal output is a safe verdict.
